# Objectives
1. Understanding instructor's code as you code along, not just blindy copying the code.
2. Read OpenCV and Mediapipe docs to see why instructor wrote code like in the video.
3. Play around on your own for fun.  Look around on OpenCV and Mediapipe and see anything you'd like to do differently. For example, I learnt how to play video from file and write hand landmarks on the video as a Python begineer.
